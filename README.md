# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman game project! This is a simple Java console-based implementation of the classic Hangman game.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to enhance my coding skills and showcase my abilities as a software developer. 
It is a learning exercise where I explore Java programming concepts, file handling, user input handling, and overall project organization.

## How to Play

1. **Choose a Theme:**
   - Before starting the game, choose a theme from the available options, such as animals, countries, drinks, foods, fruits, or vegetables.

2. **Guess the Word:**
   - Guess one letter at a time to reveal the hidden word.
   - Correct guesses will reveal the letters, while incorrect guesses add to the hanging man.

3. **Win or Lose:**
   - Win by guessing the entire word within the maximum allowed mistakes (10).
   - Lose if the hanging man is fully drawn.
